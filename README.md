## Installation

To run QuBiT on your iPhone, follow these detailed steps:

1. **Ensure Prerequisites Are Met**:
   - Make sure [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is installed on your Mac. Xcode is necessary for iOS app development and installation.
   - Verify that your iOS device (iPhone or iPad) is running iOS 16 or later. Although QuBiT is designed for both iPhone and iPad, it is optimized for iPhone.

2. **Clone the QuBiT Repository**:
   Use the Terminal on your Mac to clone the QuBiT repository from GitHub. Execute the following commands:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QuBiT.git
   cd QuBiT

3. **Downloading QuBiT**:
Use a USB cable to connect your iOS device to your Mac.
Unlock your iOS device and, if prompted, choose to trust the computer.

Within Xcode, select your connected iOS device as the target device from the drop-down menu at the top of the window.

4. **iPhone settings**:
Before running the app, you need to trust the developer (Roy Luo) on your iOS device. This is a security measure for apps not downloaded through the App Store.
Go to Settings > General > Device Management on your iOS device.
Under "Developer App", tap on "Roy Luo (royluo05@gmail.com)" and then tap "Trust".

5. **Run the App**:
Back in Xcode, press the Run button (represented by a play icon) to build and run the application on your connected iOS device.
The first build may take some time as Xcode prepares the app. Subsequent builds will be faster.

Once installed, you can disconnect your iOS device from your Mac.
You can now launch QuBiT directly from your iOS device at any time, just like any other app installed on your device.
